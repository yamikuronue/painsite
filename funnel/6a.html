<div class="home">
  <h1>Get up and move around</h1>
  <p>I know you feel like crap right now, and it's hard to get up and get moving. I'm not saying hit the gym or anything, but can you find a simple task you can do, like some dishes or vaccuming?
  Or can you take a short walk around the block maybe? Just getting up and moving around a bit can help. At the very least, stretch your hamstrings for a few minutes.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
  <a href="7.html" class="btn">OK, I moved a bit more.</a>
  </div>
