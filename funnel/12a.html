<div class="home">
  <h1>Go talk to someone</h1>
  <p>Do you have someone you can call that you don't mind talking to right now? How about online, do you have a forum or a chat room you like to visit? What about facebook? Skype? Just try and reach out to another person.
  It's okay if all you talk about is how much you feel like crap, so long as you're able to talk to a human being.</p>
  <p>If you're considering hurting yourself, and you can't find someone to talk to, you can call 1-800-273-TALK or go to <a href="https://www.imalive.org/">imalive.org</a> to find someone to talk to about it.</p>
