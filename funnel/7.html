  <h1>Have you been outside?</h1>
  <p>The outdoors can be a scary place, but if it's daytime, a little sunshine can work wonders for your mood. The sunlight actually has an effect on your brain chemistry, believe it or not. Even if it's night, the fresh 
  air can make you feel a bit more human.</p>
